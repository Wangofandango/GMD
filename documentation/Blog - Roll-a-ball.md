#Roll-a-ball blogpost

I tried something entirely new today, i tried following the tutorial for Roll-a-ball found here: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball

It was quite a fun experience, since it was my first time ever "playing around" inside of Unity.

The tutorial taught me how to start a new project, creating and manipulating "GameoObjects". By both size, color, and adding features / scripts to these "GameObjects.

Specifically, i was introduced to the physics system in Unity, which was applied through a component that could be added to the in-engine objects (such as the "plane" or "player") called "RigidBody".

Also related to the physics, i was given scripts to add as a component to (Mainly) the player "Gameobject". Which enabled me to be able to use inputs, to actually move the player object.
Interesting note here, adding a field inside of the script which in this case was "accelleration", i was able to modify this value from 10 to 20 or 30, to test different acceleration values for the player objects.

It was also possible to "turn on" the game, and then change all sorts of values, colors, and other neat settings. only for testing purposes, and then have them be removed when "turning off" the playtest. So that i was able to play around with colors, widths, different acceleration speeds and so on. Which i thought was very cool and useful (up until the point where i actually lost progress because of this ðŸ˜­ )

However, the tutorial removed a lot of the "programming struggle" or "understanding" that i aim to get within the GMD course, such as the base methods within the script didnt need to be used in some scenarios so we actually removed them. Which makes me think as a programmer, why? When is it used? Why delete it? It was kind of a "dumbed down" approach, to make everyone able to get "onboard". But i am pretty stoked to look more into programming scripts and working in unity in the future. And hopefully understand more about what i am doing, instead of mindlessly following along :D
