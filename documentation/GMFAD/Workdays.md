# Workdays / sessions
## And What i found out


# Session 1
- 1.5 hours

**Movement System**
I decided on using the most simple and well documented form of movement, that i could find. So i ended up using the older "Input Manager" 
to control my player. 

**Camera System**
Decided on currently just having the camera follow the player from a perfect 90 degree top down view. Don't know if anything else is possible, but i will look into that later.

**Tilemap**
I tried going a bit into texturing and tilemapping, to get a feel for how it works. I had hoped i would be able to make a simple tilemap. Currently i am only able to seperate grass and wooden walls on their own layers called "Ground" and "Collisions" respectively.
This way i should have some strong foundations going forward.
